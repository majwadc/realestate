## Property Finder App 

This web application Real was built on React.JS and Rapid API to fetch real estate information, there isn't any authentication for this application. For deployment I have used Vercel. This application was built by me as self learning way to understand how to use React.JS and Rapid API. 
# Available Scripts 

```bash 
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
